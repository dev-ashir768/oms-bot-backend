========================================= SECTION 1: GENERAL SETTINGS

Picklist & Print Settings

Picklist Creation:
Picklist is the list of items a rider needs to collect—choose "By Orders" to pick per customer or "By Products" to pick the same items in bulk across orders.

By Orders:

Shows products grouped under each order.

You can see the Order ID next to each product.

Useful when the rider picks items order by order.

By Products:

Shows products grouped together across all orders, without listing Order IDs.

Useful when the rider picks all units of a product in bulk, minimizing walking in the warehouse.

AWB (AirWayBill) Details:

Include product details -> Shows all items on the label.

Simple -> Only basic info, no item details.

Show SKU -> Toggle SKU display on print.

AWB (AirWayBill) Layout:

Compact -> Small label.

Thermal -> Optimized for thermal printers.

Full page (A4) -> Prints on A4 paper.

Prints per page -> Choose 1, 2, or 3 AWBs per page.

WhatsApp Settings

Service Selection:

Official API -> Full interaction, cost per conversation.

Web API -> Simple notifications, cost per message.

Phone Number Field -> Add your WhatsApp number.

Actions:

Chat Icon -> Link WhatsApp after scanning QR.

Search Icon -> Check connection status.

Trash Icon -> Remove linked number.

Scan & Update Settings

Select Status -> Pick a shipment stage (e.g., Booked, Ready for Return).

How it works: Scan a shipment in scan and update module → update status → tags are automatically added.
